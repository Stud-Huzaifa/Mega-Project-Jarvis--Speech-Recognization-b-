# JARVIS - Voice Assistant

JARVIS is a simple Python-based voice assistant that can recognize voice commands and respond with speech. This project demonstrates how to use speech recognition and text-to-speech in Python to create a basic virtual assistant.

## Features

- **Speech Recognition:** Listens to your voice commands and converts them into text.
- **Text-to-Speech:** Converts text responses back into speech.
- **Basic Commands:** 
  - Greet the user.
  - Introduce itself.
  - Respond to questions like "How are you?".
  - Exit the program with voice commands like "exit", "quit", or "bye".

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run JARVIS on your local machine, you need the following:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Internet connection (for Google Speech Recognition)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/jarvis-voice-assistant.git
    cd jarvis-voice-assistant
    ```

2. **Install the required Python packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the JARVIS assistant:**
    ```bash
    python jarvis.py
    ```

### Usage

After starting the assistant, JARVIS will listen for your voice commands. You can say commands like:

- "Hello" - JARVIS will greet you.
- "What is your name?" - JARVIS will introduce itself.
- "How are you?" - JARVIS will respond with how itâ€™s doing.
- "Exit", "Quit", or "Bye" - JARVIS will say goodbye and stop running.
